# no namer unblocker
**ITS NODEJS NOT HTML** 

unoptimized and shit unblocker which uses <a href="https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker">node-unblocker</a> (barely works/laggy on school networks?)
gets the job done but unrecommended if you are actively trying to hide your history/unblock your shit.

I dont recommend this but you do you.

updates unlikely,
please dont contact me over this,
this was a project for fun and i dont plan on fucking on this again unless i wanna test out shit

if you plan on using this, deploy it on a VPS because this is horribly coded and needs A LOT of performance power (last i checked btw)
*Replit doesnt support proxys/unblockers so avoid that lol*

#### to do:
- FUCKING ADD A BETTER PROXY :pray:
- fix some shit (very buggy)
- actually make my own front end or some shit like that
- make a actual name other than "no name blocker" :sob:
- actual settings tab that isn't just json

#### Features:
- Pretty customizable
- Barely any errors (:pray:)
- Basically has everything other proxys have other than built-in games

#### Supports
- Youtube.com
- Discord.com
- Google.com
- Reddit.com
- Bing.com
- More unlisted ones (idk why you would need that???????????????????/)

# setup

probably inaccurate (or doesnt work) so uh you might wanna build it yourself
its actually just quite easy
you just unzip it once you've downloaded it go to the main folder (with index.js) and run "npm install" after that you can open visual studio code to run index.js or use "npm start"

```
git clone https://github.com/trollinq/no-namer-unblocker
cd no-namer-unblocker
npm install
npm start
```
