# no namer unblocker
**ITS NODEJS NOT HTML** 
**WHEN STARTING UP TRY TO USE INDEX.MJS AND NOT INDEX.JS! INDEX.JS IS ONLY THERE IF YOU ARE FORCED TO RUN INDEX.JS!**

unoptimized and shit proxy which uses <a href="https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker">node-unblocker</a> (barely works/laggy on school networks?/slow?) and ultra violet (secure?/very laggy/slow)
gets the job done but unrecommended if you are actively trying to hide your history/unblock your shit.

I dont recommend this but you do you.
please dont contact me over this,
this was a project for fun and i dont plan on fucking around on this again unless i wanna test out shit

if you plan on using this, deploy it on a VPS because this is horribly coded and needs A LOT of performance power (last i checked btw)

**oh yea uh the bare server actually isnt in the source code and is just some random ass replit!**

**if you want a truly 24/7 ultra-violet proxy experience please try out another proxy or host your own bare server thing**

# setup
probably inaccurate (or doesnt work) so uh you might wanna build it yourself
its actually just quite easy
you just unzip it once you've downloaded it go to the main folder (with index.mjs & index.js) and run "npm install" after that you can open visual studio code to run index.mjs (or index.js) or use "npm start" (i think idk lol)

```
git clone https://github.com/trollinq/no-namer-unblocker
cd no-namer-unblocker
npm install
npm start
```
